  "page-primer-contents-intro-h3": "Today, digital public goods are valued at more than 400 billion dollars!",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-one": "Itâ€™s easy to understand why: open source technologies power our internet infrastructure! Public goods are good ðŸ’ª.",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-two": "But, for the people behind these public goods, it is insanely expensive to create and maintain for little to no social rewardâ€” and even more expensive to sustain as a full-time activity.",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-three": "Why? Because current business models who want to use open source software on the internet get it for free, and no funding models exist to support the people creating these cyber-physical commons.",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-four": "This was until we had truly internet-native organizations, such as GitcoinDAO! Almost all of the aspects of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) are internet-native: offices exist on online chat platforms, money and collectibles exist in the form of cryptocurrencies and tokens, and coordination happens globally all the time, online and on-chain.",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-five": "Today, there are about X DAOs that manage a treasury worth Y million dollars or Z ETH. A whopping X number of people work in these DAOs in different roles. That's a lot, and it is only bound to increase!",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-six": "Due to the ease of contributing to a DAO, the social incentives they offer, and the transformative potential of this unique coordination tool, it is becoming commonplace for aspiring internet-native folks to quickly find their way in a lot of the groups where DAOs happen (typically Discord servers), adding thousands of users month after month. The roles are as diverse as that of a traditional centralized organization, in addition to the ones that web3 has introduced. As a result, people are figuring out how to work in a DAO. This primer explains how!",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-seven": "With the increased possibilities of web3 and cryptotechnology, the demand for DAOplomats is increasing exponentially on all sides - infrastructure, tech, design, governance, project management, finance, operations, stewardship, and coordination.",
  "page-primer-contents-intro-text-eight": "DAOs that build and fund public goods need a wide-ranging array of talent across all fields of society - technology, culture, economics, and policy. Enter GitcoinDAO",
  "page-primer-contents-what-text-one": "GitcoinDAOâ€™s main focus is to build and fund digital public goods to 'grow open source'. Digital public goods are free, open-source cultural works. They can take the form of software, data sets, AI models, standards or content and are distributed freely and modified by anyone around the world. GitcoinDAO believes that digital public goods have the potential to solve our toughest challenges now and in the future. However, despite $300B+ in yearly economic output, open-source developers have traditionally not had effective ways to monetize their work.",
  "page-primer-contents-what-text-two": "To tackle this problem, GitcoinDAO was established as an organization that distributes funds to these open-source innovators. Its mission is to serve the greater good by funding open-source projects that will allow us to tackle some of humanityâ€™s most complex issues. Since its launch in November 2017, Gitcoin Grants has provided nearly $16M of project funding.",
  "page-primer-contents-who-h3-one": "Builders",
  "page-primer-contents-who-text-one": "who want to build digital public goods (code, art, etc) that can use Gitcoin to power our new web.",
  "page-primer-contents-who-h3-two": "Users",
  "page-primer-contents-who-text-two": "who want to use these public goods for their communities built on Gitcoin to do so.",
  "page-primer-contents-who-h3-three": "You",
  "page-primer-contents-who-text-three": "such as Twitch who have large audiences and high streaming bills or infrastructure costs can use Gitcoin to reduce costs or infrastructure overhead.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-h3-one": "Meet Alisha",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-one": "Alisha and her friends are freelance developers, designers, and podcasters. She joined Gitcoin to build open source software and graphics for better coordination tools, such as pay.party- a tool that helps distribute payouts to everyone who contributes. She has also invited her friends to help her with getting the word out via different artistic mediums. The funding for the project comes from GitcoinDAO.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-h3-two": "Meet Ben",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-two": "Ben is a coordinator and project manager in charge of scaling the web2 app for the company he works for during the day. He makes DAO projects like pay.party more efficient by sparing a few hours after work. After a couple of months, Ben decides to go full-time at the GitcoinDAO and becomes a steward of one of the workstreams.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-three": "When Ben goes on Discord and discusses the project updates with the team Alisha and her friends, pay.party gets tested, iterated on, and is launched as a public good for the entire world. The tool is not only used in Gitcoin for building itself but becomes a part of the critical infrastructure of web3.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-four": "Today is a really important day for Ben. It's the public launch of their first moonshot- pay.party! How can Alice be sure that the dApp that she and her friends have been building works the way it is intended? At Gitcoin, we celebrate both failure and success. This is where stewards play an important role.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-five": "There are two key actors in the GitcoinDAO ecosystem that ensure it's success: Stewards and Delegators.",
  "page-primer-contents-how-text-six": "First, let's go over the role of Stewards.",
  "page-primer-contents-orchestrators-text-one": "In GitcoinDAO, anyone can join the community and governance forums and become what's known as a steward. A steward deeply understands the spirit of public goods and leads their team to completion of these projects.",
  "page-primer-contents-orchestrators-text-two": "For doing so, a steward, like Ben, proposes a budget for the workstream in the native token of the GitcoinDAO community- GTC. The contributors to the workstream are rewarded in GTC for their contributions.",
  "page-primer-contents-orchestrators-text-three": "Sounds good, right? But wait, there's a catch! In order to earn the right to do this type of work on the network, the workstream must first earn or acquire Gitcoin Token, also known as GTC.",
  "page-primer-contents-token-text-one": "At its core, the Gitcoin (GTC) is a governance token. It was created as a means to incentivize individuals to contribute to Gitcoin's mission. Kind of like a share in a company, it's inherent value is driven by a combination of factors including supply, demand, and the success of the organization. It also holds voting power within the DAO - if someone holds even a small amount of Gitcoin, they have the power to vote on governance decisions within the organization.",
  "page-primer-contents-token-text-two": "For now, most payments to the staff and contributors are calculated in USD and distributed in GTC. Though there are some fluctuations in the price of GTC (like the stock of a company), in the long run the intention is that GTC will become more stable and gradually increase in value. These GTC payments are sent to cryptocurrency wallets where contributors can either keep or convert the funds into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. People who get paid in GTC are responsible for what they do with their tokens. Turning it into their country's currency and paying taxes accordingly is the responsibility of each recipient.",
  "page-primer-contents-token-text-three": "There's another set of actors in the Gitcoin protocol who play an equally important role within the protocol â€” the Delegators of GTC.",
  "page-primer-contents-delegators-text-one": "Delegators are Gitcoin tokenholders who participate in the governance and stake their tokens towards stewards who they believe are doing good and honest work. You can think about staking like putting a deposit down. When you stake, your tokens become locked up for a period of time and then you can take them back or stake them to a different steward. Doing this helps ensure that the steward is accountable, and has the funds from the Gitcoin treasury to help support their projects.",
  "page-primer-contents-delegators-text-two": "You may be wondering, why would a tokenholder stake their tokens? What's in it for them, besides making a steward's day and earning bragging rights in the public goods community?",
  "page-primer-contents-rewarding-text-one": "TODO from hereon: When a delegator pays fees into the network, both stewards and Delegators earn a portion of those fees as a reward for ensuring a high-quality and secure network.",
  "page-primer-contents-rewarding-text-two": "In addition to earning fees, Gitcoin mints new token over time, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum block rewards, which are split amongst Delegators and orchestrators in proportion to their total stake relative to others in the network.",
  "page-primer-contents-rewarding-text-three": "This has the effect of growing network ownership amongst those who participate and shrinking it amongst those who do not.",
  "page-primer-contents-rewarding-text-four": "It also gives orchestrators a powerful economic advantage over traditional centralized video providers since the value of the token offsets what they need to charge broadcasters to break even. With traditional centralized video providers, they have to charge you their cost of service for transcoding and distributing video plus a margin.",
  "page-primer-contents-rewarding-text-five": "Neat right? Next, let's go over how often new tokens are minted.",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-h3-one": "Gitcoin Grant Rounds",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-text-one": "In Gitcoin, new tokens are minted every so-called round. Rounds are measured in Ethereum blocks, where one round is equal to <strong>{{ethereumBlocksPerRound}}</strong> Ethereum blocks. In Ethereum, one block is mined on average every <strong>{{blockTime}}</strong> seconds, which means one Gitcoin round lasts roughly <strong>{{hoursPerRound}}</strong> hours. Assuming the Orchestrator you're staked to is doing its job, this is how often you can expect to receive reward tokens.",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-text-two": "Next, let's go over the Gitcoin inflation rate, or in other words, the way by which the Gitcoin protocol determines how many new tokens to mint each round.",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-h3-two": "Inflation",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-text-three": "The current rate of inflation as of today's round is <strong>{{inflation}}%</strong> and there are currently a total of <strong>{{totalSupply}}</strong> Gitcoin tokens in supply. So, if you do the math, a total of <strong>{{mintableTokens}}</strong> newly minted Gitcoin tokens will be rewarded to all participants during the next round.",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-text-four": "The cool thing about Gitcoin is the inflation rate adjusts automatically depending on how many tokens are staked out of the total circulating supply. Currently, the total supply of Gitcoin tokens stands at <strong>{{totalSupply}}</strong> and of those, <strong>{{totalStaked}}</strong> are staked. Gitcoin refers to this ratio (<strong>{{participationRate}}</strong>%) as its 'participation rate'.",
  "page-primer-contents-rounds-text-five": "Gitcoin presupposes that a target rate of <strong>{{targetRate}}%</strong> is a healthy trade-off between network security and token liquidity, so in order to hit this target, the protocol incentivizes participation by increasing the inflation rate by <strong>{{inflationChange}}%</strong> for every round the participation rate is below <strong>{{targetRate}}%</strong> and decreasing it <strong>{{inflationChange}}%</strong> for every round the participation rate is above <strong>{{targetRate}}%</strong>.",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-h2": "Gitcoin IS GROWING!",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-text-one": "Today, there are <strong>{{totalDelegators}}</strong> delegators securing the network, with more and more participants joining the network every day.",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-interested": "Interested in participating?",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-interested-text-one": "Get Gitcoin token",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-interested-cta-one": "GET TOKEN",
  "page-primer-contents-involved-interested-text-two": "Stake token towards an Orchestrator",
